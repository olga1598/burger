# Burger

***

*Eat-Da-Burger!* Is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- Burgers available to eat.

- Each burger also has a Eat me! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page -- Burgers that have been devoured.

- The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
